**When application for CMC and CoinGecko?**

The application to CoinMarketCap has been filled, now it's up to them to list us.

With regards to CoinGecko, it has a requirement of at least 500 wallet holding $SRHIMP, as we are a very recent project we are still growing and as soon as we reach that number we will apply immediately to be listed there as well.

**When audit and why is it taking so long?**

The contracts are open source, you can read their code [here](core-products/contracts.md). They are based on SaltSwap which has been audited by Certik, we will apply for the same audit as soon as there are enough funds from the deposit fees. Also, it's not taking that long since the project is fairly recent.

**What will happen to shrimp rewards after Phase 1?**

You can read more about our [roadmap \(here\)](roadmap.md).

**What will "integration to ADA, Cardano Blockchain" exactly mean?**

It means we will be able to use $SHRIMP in the Cardano Blockchain, in essence, expanding from the Binance Smart Chain.

**Whend did you launch?**

We've officially launched on April 21st.

**How many $SHRIMP are there in total?**

At the time of writing there is a maximum circulation supply of less than 19M tokens, you can keep track of the supply in [shrimpswap.finance](https://shrimpswap.finance/) (Statistics section).
