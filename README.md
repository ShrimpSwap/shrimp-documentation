# ShrimpSwap, get some of the fruit of the sea!

> Bubba : Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.

**Why SHRIMP?**

We believe that the current yield farm ecosystem is suffering from hyperdeflation, i.e. the extremely large decrease in the general prices of tokens in the blockchain. This results in a deflationary spiral which leads to less appreciation of the token, lower Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) and lower demand for the tokens in general, and thus deposit levels. This scenario creates a deflationary environment which does not serve the interests of the parties involved.

In order to solve this problem we have developed a contract in the Binance Smart Chain to combat the endemic hyperdeflation of the ecosystem and increase investor confidence; introducing the **SHRIMP deflationary token**. [Read More](deflationary-token.md)

**Why Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)?**

In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does currently, we believe in Binance's ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future. For example, recent data shows that for every 10 smart contracts that were built on Ethereum, there were 40 smart contracts built on Binance Smart Chain. It shows that a serious development is taking place about smart contracts on the Binance side, perhaps because of the competitive gas fees.

**What makes ShrimpSwap different from every other "farm"?**

On top of the fact that we are a highly qualified team, we believe that a deflationary token can bring a lot to the table. On one hand, the majority of the other farms have inflationary tokens and no limit on the amount of tokens that can be farmed. On the other hand, SHRIMP is deflationary and the total supply will be limited, guaranteeing the value of the token.
