# What happens after Shrimp rewards end?
The shrimp token becomes deflactionary. No more shrimps are created.

# Will there be rewards for SHRIMP LP providers?
Yes, we will introduce a new smart contract where you can stake your SHRIMP-BNB and SHRIMP-BUSD V2 LP tokens to get rewards

# How do I convert my V1 LPs to V2 LPs?
You can remove the LP liquidity on shrimpswap, then head to pancakeswap and create the V2 LP with your liquidity. 
If you want you can do everything in pancakeswap, using their V1 and V2 sites.
There is no automatic conversion on our side, all this conversion must be manually done.

# Will you migrate the exchange to V2?

# Why do we need to wait 10 days?
We want to give the opportunity for everyone to switch over, it is the holiday time so take your time. Also we can bring more users by providing a big window of opportunity to join the new reward contract
